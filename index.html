            <div class="indent-30px">
                <p class="numbered-list">Treat all staff in the Medical Centre with the same courtesy and respect that you expect to receive whilst you are in the Medical Centre.  Remember you are subject to military discipline.</p>
                <p class="numbered-list">Ensure you give your doctor full information on your problems so that he has all the facts to assess and manage your case.</p>
                <p class="numbered-list">Keep your appointments and ensure you arrive in good time.  If for any reason you are unable to keep your appointment cancel it in plenty of time to give others the opportunity to make an appointment.  This Medical Centre keeps records of those who fail to attend appointments and accountability is requested from the unit.</p>
                <p class="numbered-list">Make sure you book any necessary medical well in advance and do not assume your medical can be fitted in at the last minute.</p>
                <p class="numbered-list">Book a longer medical appointment if you know you will require more time, and be patient if the doctor is running late due to extra patients and urgent problems.</p>
                <p class="numbered-list">Use the weekend and out of hours services correctly, only when necessary and for acute conditions.</p>
                <p class="numbered-list">Order repeat prescriptions in good time before you are nearing the end of your medication – minimum of 48hrs</p>

            <h3>Patient Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>Please be assured that all staff in the Practice regard patient confidentiality as a high priority. All patient information is confidential and protected by law. This information can only be given to other medical personnel involved in your care. It will not be given to any other individual. Only under exceptional circumstances can clinical information be given to commanding officers: your medical centre will be happy to explain these in detail:</p>

            <p><b>Healthcare Assurance Visits:</b> Medical teams periodically inspect your healthcare medical facilities to ensure that high standards are being maintained. Such visits include the Care Quality Commission, groups approved by the General Medical Council and Healthcare Governance and Assurance Visits arranged by the Defence Medical Services. The visiting medical team may carry out quality assurance checks on a proportion of Service and National Health Service medical records. Any confidential medical information about an individual will not be divulged by the visiting team; however, individuals have the right to deny access to their own documents should they so wish. Such checks will only be conducted by a qualified medical professional.</p>

            <p><b>Action Required by Service Personnel:</b> Service Personnel are to inform their dependants that if they are registered with the medical centre, visiting doctors and medical personnel may inspect their medical records.</p>

            <p><b>Action to Deny Access:</b> Any individual who does not wish their records to be inspected should inform their doctor in writing.</p>

            <p>

                <b>What to do if you are not happy</b><br>
                <br>
                If you have a complaint about the service the medical centre provides for you, there is an Informal Complaints Procedure run by the medical centre to deal with your concerns. We hope you will use this, as it gives us the opportunity of looking into and, if necessary, correcting, any problems which may have arisen or mistakes that may have been made. Your opinions are important and, when appropriate, practice procedures will be modified. Our aim is to maintain and improve the quality of service provided to our patients.<br>
                <br>
                Please note that we have a duty of confidentiality to patients and the patient’s consent will be necessary if the patient does not wish to make the complaint directly.<br>
                <br>
                If you wish to make a complaint, please contact the <b>Medical Complaints Manager (MCM) Miranda Smart</b> by telephone, letter or email. You will be provided with an Annex B, and on submission of this annex, your complaint will be investigated and you will receive further information within 10 working days.<br>
                <br>
                You will then be offered a meeting with a senior member of staff to discuss the matter. You may bring a friend or relative with you to the meeting if you wish. At the meeting we hope to address your concerns fully, provide you with an explanation and discuss any action that may be taken. We trust that at the end of the meeting you will feel satisfied that the matter has been resolved. If you do not wish to have such a meeting, a letter of explanation will be sent to you.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What happens if you are still not happy?</b><br>
                <br>
                If you feel that your complaint has not been resolved, the Medical Complaints Manager will be able to advise you about the next stage<br>

                DPHC is committed to providing a high quality medical service.  To ensure high standards in care are maintained, a visit of medical establishments is undertaken.  The HGAV involves inspecting all aspects of care provision.<br>
                <br>
                Some medical records will be inspected by the visiting team to ensure they are accurately maintained and in compliance with good medical practice.<br>
                <br>
                The team are all members of the Defence Medical Services.  They are bound by the strict code of medical confidentiality as laid down by the Department of Health.<br>
